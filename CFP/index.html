    <h2>Call for papers</h2>
    <p>
        We invite researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to submit their contributions to our full-day workshop on Sustainability in LLM-assisted Software Development (SILAS), which explores the intersection of software development, large language models (LLMs), and sustainability.
    
        As LLMs become widely adopted in software engineering workflows—from code generation and testing to design and review—their energy consumption and environmental impact must be better understood and addressed. This workshop provides a forum for sharing new ideas, evaluating practices, and proposing sustainable approaches to integrating LLMs into software development.
    
        We welcome submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Datasets for resource usage evaluation;</li>
            <li>Generation of efficient code with LLMs;</li>
            <li>Empirical studies on LLM usage and its impact;</li>
            <li>LLM profiling and benchmarking;</li>
            <li>Efficient, repeatable prompting strategies;</li>
            <li>Tools and techniques to reduce LLM resource consumption.</li>
        </ul>
    
        Papers should be 4–6 pages long, including references, and will undergo peer review for relevance, novelty, soundness, and clarity. We encourage surprising perspectives and bold ideas—even without full evaluations—though evaluated techniques are certainly welcome.
    
        Submission is via <a href="">EasyChair</a> and papers should follow the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE format</a>.
        The deadline for submissions is May 26, 2025.
